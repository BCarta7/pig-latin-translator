# About

This was a guided project during LEARN academy's full stack boot camp. Using pair programming techniques, my team tested our skills in javascript logic by developing a function to translate user input into "pig latin".

### ðŸ’¬ Rules of Pig Latin

- For words beginning with a vowel, add "way" to the end.
- For words beginning with one or more consonants, move all of the first consecutive consonants to the end, and add "ay".
- If the first consonants include "qu", move the "u" along with the "q". Don't forget about words like "squeal" where "qu" doesn't come first!
- "y" is treated like a vowel in appropriate circumstances.
